    "# Conway's Game of life\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simply known as Life is a zero-player game, cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is an incredible model because of how simple it is. He manages to exlpain a whole universe of life in three extremely simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you should know when you talk of a game is what it is and whats its rules are. The universe of the game of life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of the two possible states, live(1) or dead(0) (or on or off). The life of a cell is completely dependent on the neighbours (defined next) of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 1: Any live cell with less than two live neigbours dies by *Underpopulation*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 2: Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 3: Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies by *Overpopulation*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 4: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell *Reproduction*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Life* breaks life down to extremely simple and essential parts. Like *Yayoi Kusama* once said: \"Bring on Picasso, bring on Matisse, bring on anybody! I would stand up to them all with a single polka dot!\". She aims to create art that makes people experience infinity, with just polka dots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we learn here is that however complex a problem maybe, it can be broken down to its core elements, and it is these elements inform the creative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neighbourhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of neighbourhoods; Moore and von Neumann neighbourhood. Moore neighbourhood consists or all the eight cells surrounding the central cell (i,j).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Moore Neighbourhood: In cellular automata, the Moore neighborhood is defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and the eight cells that surround it. [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"mooreneighbourhood.png\" alt=\"moore neighbourhood\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Von Neumann Neighbourhood: In cellular automata, the von Neumann neighborhood (or 4-neighborhood) is classically defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and its four adjacent cells. Here is an example of Von Neumann neighbourhood of a cell with a radius of 3. [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"von neumann neighbourhood.png\" alt=\"von neumann neighbourhood\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other very interesting neighbourhoods that are used in different systems that are extensions of these with different radii. You can refer to [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333524697_Mechanisms_for_Cell-to-cell_and_Cell-free_Spread_of_HIV-1_in_Cellular_Automata_Models) if you want to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why these rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conway went thought many other rules and settled on this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk). There are as many combinations of rules as there are combinations of numbers to use for determining when a cell lives or dies. Now we do not want cells to die out *too quickly* nor do we want them to live on forever. So the criteria followed by Conway were [[more details]](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in the following possible ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Fading away completely (from overcrowding or from becoming too sparse)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interesting patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some very interesting patterns that I observed while the simulation was running, at different initial states and some pre-known initial states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common pattern types include: still lifes, which do not change from one generation to the next; oscillators, which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and spaceships, which translate themselves across the grid.\n",

    "# The tweaks\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to make the game window colorful. So thiking along those lines, I have made a code for genetic component that the daughter cell chooses from its 8 parents (so we will have 256 possibilities). I added color as a trait that is chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modified rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the modified rules for the genetic model of Conway's game of life. I have kept all the rules from the *life* as it is and added these changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Inheritance from Neighbors: \n",
    "- A daughter cell, if born, from exactly three neighbours, randomly inherits colors from two live neighbours (dominant parents).\n",
    "- The color of both is blended together to create the daughter. To do this, I took the average of values of the (R,G,B) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Color as a trait: Each live cell has a particular color that it passes on to the next generation by random inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Colors that survive keep the color. That is, a live cell with 2 or 3 neighbours, keeps its original color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation with color is extremely beautiful and insightful to look at. And tells us about the inheritance of dominant trait (color).\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is another more contrasting color schemed random generation (just because its pretty). If you notice carefully, one can see the localised colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other observations are:\n",
    "- As the new cells are born we can see a dynamics evolution of color.\n",
    "- This might also lead us to see a gradient across the game window.\n",
    "- We also see patches (localised) of genes.\n",
    "- Higher the population, higher is the blending of color and vice versa.\n",
    "- If a live cell surviews for multiple generations, the color of the cell remains unchanged for long periods and may become into a dense solid color pocket if a few neighbouring cells are also staying alive from a long period of time.\n",
    "- As the selection of live cells is a random generation, and the selection of color of the cells is a random generation, it can lead to a much more unpredictable result, hence more random. And might not be reproducible.\n",
    "- If a region is alive for a while then the colors become belnded and less distinct. Much like what happens in inheritance of genes.\n",

    "- In physics, it is used in the ising model, where eaach cell is in either \"up\" state or \"down\" state, amking an idealized representation of a magnet.\n",

    "- It is also used to simulate fluids, as they obey laws of thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Game of life is used for modelling complex systems, that are non-linear in all fields of science eg: metrology, cosmology, engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The patterns of stability will arise but will be veyr hard to predict. This helps us understand the chaotic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is used to observe data, model system, tweak systems. In the read about a few other ideas like quantum game of life, energy states, phase transitions.\n",
