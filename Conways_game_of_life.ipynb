    "# Conway's Game of life\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simply known as Life is a zero-player game, cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is an incredible model because of how simple it is. He manages to exlpain a whole universe of life in three extremely simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you should know when you talk of a game is what it is and whats its rules are. The universe of the game of life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of the two possible states, live(1) or dead(0) (or on or off). The life of a cell is completely dependent on the neighbours (defined next) of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 1: Any live cell with less than two live neigbours dies by *Underpopulation*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 2: Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 3: Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies by *Overpopulation*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule 4: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell *Reproduction*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Life* breaks life down to extremely simple and essential parts. Like *Yayoi Kusama* once said: \"Bring on Picasso, bring on Matisse, bring on anybody! I would stand up to them all with a single polka dot!\". She aims to create art that makes people experience infinity, with just polka dots. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we learn here is that however complex a problem maybe, it can be broken down to its core elements, and it is these elements inform the creative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neighbourhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of neighbourhoods; Moore and von Neumann neighbourhood. Moore neighbourhood consists or all the eight cells surrounding the central cell (i,j).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Moore Neighbourhood: In cellular automata, the Moore neighborhood is defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and the eight cells that surround it. [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Von Neumann Neighbourhood: In cellular automata, the von Neumann neighborhood (or 4-neighborhood) is classically defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and its four adjacent cells. Here is an example of Von Neumann neighbourhood of a cell with a radius of 3. [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood)\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other very interesting neighbourhoods that are used in different systems that are extensions of these with different radii. You can refer to [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333524697_Mechanisms_for_Cell-to-cell_and_Cell-free_Spread_of_HIV-1_in_Cellular_Automata_Models) if you want to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why these rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conway went thought many other rules and settled on this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk). There are as many combinations of rules as there are combinations of numbers to use for determining when a cell lives or dies. Now we do not want cells to die out *too quickly* nor do we want them to live on forever. So the criteria followed by Conway were [[more details]](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html):\n",

    "- There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in the following possible ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Fading away completely (from overcrowding or from becoming too sparse)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.\n",

    "Here are some very interesting patterns that I observed while the simulation was running, at different initial states and some pre-known initial states. \n",

    "\n",
    "I wanted to make the game window colorful. So thiking along those lines, I have made a code for genetic component that the daughter cell chooses from its 8 parents (so we will have 256 possibilities). I added color as a trait that is chosen randomly.\n",

    "## Modified rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the modified rules for the genetic model of Conway's game of life. I have kept all the rules from the *life* as it is and added these changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Inheritance from Neighbors: \n",
    "- A daughter cell, if born, from exactly three neighbours, randomly inherits colors from two live neighbours (dominant parents).\n",
    "- The color of both is blended together to create the daughter. To do this, I took the average of values of the (R,G,B) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Color as a trait: Each live cell has a particular color that it passes on to the next generation by random inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Colors that survive keep the color. That is, a live cell with 2 or 3 neighbours, keeps its original color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation with color is extremely beautiful and insightful to look at. And tells us about the inheritance of dominant trait (color).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is another more contrasting color schemed random generation (just because its pretty). If you notice carefully, one can see the localised colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other observations are:\n",
    "- As the new cells are born we can see a dynamics evolution of color.\n",
    "- This might also lead us to see a gradient across the game window.\n",
    "- We also see patches (localised) of genes.\n",
    "- Higher the population, higher is the blending of color and vice versa.\n",
    "- If a live cell surviews for multiple generations, the color of the cell remains unchanged for long periods and may become into a dense solid color pocket if a few neighbouring cells are also staying alive from a long period of time.\n",
    "- As the selection of live cells is a random generation, and the selection of color of the cells is a random generation, it can lead to a much more unpredictable result, hence more random. And might not be reproducible.\n",
    "- If a region is alive for a while then the colors become belnded and less distinct. Much like what happens in inheritance of genes.\n",
